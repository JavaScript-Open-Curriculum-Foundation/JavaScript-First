// 1. Storing configuration settings for an application, such as API keys, URLs, and other settings.
// 2. Representing a user's profile, including their name, email, address, and other personal information.
// 3. Holding key-value pairs in a dictionary or a lookup table for quick access to data.
// 4. Modeling complex hierarchical data, such as a file system, an organization chart, or a product catalog.
// 5. Caching data to improve performance, such as memoization in recursive functions.
// 6. Organizing and encapsulating related functions and data in a module or a namespace.
// 7. Representing the state of a UI component, such as the current value of a form input or the checked status of a checkbox.
// 8. Describing the structure and metadata of a JSON object for data serialization and deserialization.
// 9. Storing temporary data in a client-side web application using the window.localStorage object.
// 10. Using objects as a data store for simple key-value databases, such as IndexedDB or WebSQL in the browser.
